# CIM Template
The CIM template is a repository to start a CIM, the Composable Information Machine.

This is a machine to control your information and how it is processed. When we say machine... think of the entire internet as a single machine. This is a new enabling technology that we will guide you to create a personal information system capable of semantic engagement with all your information, no matter where you choose to create it or store it.

We will start with a base platform and tailor it to your needs through a predictable, resilient pattern for storing and processing distributed information.

We will walk through each aspect of the CIM and how to connect it to big iron on the back as you grow.

We could just dump all this in your lap, but that would require several days, weeks or months to become proficient.

Learn as we go requires about 30 minutes of time to get up and running, then starting to create and form our Domain. If you have an Open AI Account, then we can immediately start using that as a conversational tools to produce our Domain.

We do it this way because every Domain is different, yes you may have some of the same elements, but you will most likely utilize those resources in a unique way, no matter how strictly you stay to the manufacturer's instructions and industry standards.

You will choose some different technology at some point and will need to adapt quickly. Disasters can and will happen, we want to be prepared for them.

After Cloning this repository and starting an Environment, we will add neo4j so we can start to visualize the Domain as we build it.

We don't need to worry about Events or Commands or Queries or Storage yet, it all lives inside this new git repository.

Let's take a look at flake.nix and get a basic understanding of what is going on here. This is our first Configuration and we want to be sure we understand what it does.
